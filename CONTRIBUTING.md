# Before PR

## Creating an issue
If you are creating an issue the following sections are required:
- **Summary**
- **Motivation**
- **Purpose**

**Issues must be labeled.**
**If applicable, assign issue to a milestone and project**

## Picking up an issue
In order to claim an issue, create a new branch that follows the following naming convention:

**\<label\>-\<issue number\>**

Then create a pull request that references your branch and assign it to a project if necessary.

# During PR

**Make sure all tests are passed before merging**

**All PRs must be approved by a listed reviewer, see OWNERS file for list of reviewers**

# After PR

**Make sure issue is closed**

**If your PR was assigned to a project, the project board should automatically move your PR and issue to the Done section**
