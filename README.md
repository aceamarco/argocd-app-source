# AppSource CRD
A decentralized manager for ArgoCD â€” allow sub-admins to create and manage their own applications on ArgoCD.
## Installation
- Create the AppSource Controller and CRD by using a single install manifest
```shell
kubectl -n argocd apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/argoproj-labs/appsource/master/manifests/install.yaml 
```

### Set Up
- Configure your AppSource controller using a configmap named [`argocd-appsource-cm`](./manifests/samples/sample_admin_config.yaml)
- Create an ArgoCD account with API capabilities
```shell
kubectl edit configmap argocd-cm -n argocd
```
```yaml
# Add this to the end of the file
data:
  accounts.appsource: apiKey, login
```
- Give your AppSource account the necessary RBAC permissions to manage ArgoCD resources
```shell
kubectl edit configmap argocd-rbac-cm -n argocd
```
```yaml
# Add this to the end of the file
data:
  policy.csv: |
    p, role:appsource, applications, *, */*, allow
    p, role:appsource, projects, *, *, allow
    p, role:appsource, repositories, *, *, allow
    p, role:appsource, cluster, *, *, allow
    p, role:appsource, clusters, *, *, allow
    g, appsource, role:appsource
```
- Create a secret containing your ArgoCD token named `argocd-appsource-secret`
```shell
export ARGOCD_TOKEN=$(argocd account generate-token --account appsource)
kubectl -n argocd create secret generic argocd-appsource-secret --from-literal argocd-token=$ARGOCD_TOKEN
```

# Usage
## Creating an ArgoCD Application

![Creating an ArgoCD Application using the AppSource custom resource](docs/assets/gif/creation.gif)

## Using the AppSource Status Resource

Users with access to the `argocd` namespace can see applications created by the controller through the ArgoCD UI

![ArgoCD UI](docs/assets/png/argocd-ui.png)

However, users without access to the `argocd` instance can use the AppSource Status field to see if their ArgoCD application was successfully created

![AppSource Status Subresource](docs/assets/gif/status.gif)

## Deleting your AppSource instance

If you included a AppSource finalizer in your AppSource manifest, deleting the AppSource resource will also delete your ArgoCD application.

## Motivation
- Organizations would like to be able to provide development teams access to ArgoCD without needing to maintain/approve actions made to the Dev team's collection of applications.
